# Ability Scores
Each character, enemy, and NPC has 4 skills: Charm, Finesse, Intuition, and Nerve.

## Charm
"Roll with Charm" when using social skills to get what you want, whether with a friendly or less-than-friendly approach. 
> **Examples**: convincing an outlaw, bartering with a shopkeeper, calming a horse.

## Finesse
"Roll with Finesse" when performing actions that require special concentration, especially dexterous activities.
> **Examples**: sneaking, tinkering, playing music, hiding an ace up your sleeve.

## Intuition
"Roll with Intuition" when observing, investigating, or otherwise trying to gain information.
> **Examples**: looking for tracks, keeping watch in the dark, sensing danger.

## Nerve
"Roll with Nerve" when you need your strength or agility to get you through a challenge.
> **Examples**: climbing up a cliff, breaking out of a net, stomaching bad beans.

## Task Difficulty
| Hits Required | Task Difficulty |
| :---: | :---: |
| 1 | _Very Easy_ |
| 2 | _Easy_ |
| 3 | _Medium_ |
| 4 | _Difficult_ |
| 5 | _Very Difficult_ |

### Challenge Rolls
If characters are challenging an opponent in some form of content, the Warden can issue a Challenge Roll. Both sides roll the same Skill to determine the outcome. Whoever has the most Hits is successful in winning the challenge. If there's a tie, that means the struggle ain't over yet! Roll again until a winner is determined.

### Helping
A Helping player may roll half of their Skill dice (rounded up) and add the result to the attempting player's Skill result. If multiple players are Helping, then they all roll half of their dice for the Skill and only the most successful roll is added to the attempting player's roll.

# Prestige
Prestige measures your fame and renown. Doing noteworthy things like hunting monsters and completing expeditions allows players to gain Prestige points that they can spend for personal improvement.

| Prestige Cost | Character Improvement |
| :---: | :--- |
| 2 | **Practice Skill**: Exchange 1B for 1G on the Skill of your choice. |

| 6 | **Master Skill**: Permanently add 1B to any chosen Skill. Usable up to 3 times. |
| 6 | **Ace-in-the-Hole 2**: Unlock the second Ace-in-the-Hole character ability. |

Players can earn a maximum of 100 Prestige; about 2/3rds of the total points required to max out all skills.
