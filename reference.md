The player may reroll Spurs if their character has unlocked the Talent for the category of roll being made. Reroll Spurs until a different result is rolled.

## Blank

1 failure.

## Misfire
A misfire happens if using real bullet dice and it lands standing straight up on its end. 

_When any player’s bullet dice Misfire, they are given to the Warden to use for any one roll as they please, including monster attacks or for an NPC's skills. This trail goes both ways however, so the Warden should be prepared to hand over their Misfired dice to the players if the time comes. The Misfired dice return to the owner once they are used in a roll._

## Non-Official Dice
If using a standard d6 instead, use the following distribution:
| D6 | Black | Gold |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | Blank | Blank |
| 2 | Blank | Spur |
| 3 | Spur | Hit |
| 4 | Hit | Hit |
| 5 | Hit | Hit |
| 6 | Ace | Ace |

# Combat
As combat begins, do the following:
1. Determine surprise
2. Establish positions
3. Roll initiative

## Combat Flow
### Turn Order
In combat, the Warden will ask the players to roll with Finesse to determine turn order. Greatest number of hits goes first. Roll again to break ties.

### Surprise
If players or enemies would be surprising their targets before combat officially begins, they will gain the first turn.

### Range
Distances are calculated using Ranges.
| Range | In-Game Distance | Movement Cost |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Arm's Reach | Within arm's reach | 1 Grit |
| Short | 30 yards or less | 1 Grit |
| Long | Between 30-90 yards | 2-3 Grid (1 per 30 yards) |
| Distant | Beyond 90 yards | 6 Grit (over at least 2 turns) |
> **Note**: Short Range attacks and Actions can be used within Arm's Reach, but not vice versa. There is no other overlap between ranges.

> **Note**: Distance to anyone inside a mech is measured to the base of the mech, ignoring vertical height for simplicity.

## Grit
During combat, each player and enemy has 6 action points called Grit. Grit is spent on Actions. The cost of these Actions are explained with each Action or item being used. Grit reloads at the start of each turn.

### Fool's Grit
Once per turn, a player can increase the amount of Grit available to them by 1 in exchange for 1 Health.

## Actions
Actions in combat situations cost Grit. If a player is attempting to accomplish something very specific and difficult with their Action, the Warden may also ask for a Skill roll to successfully complete that Action.

1. **Attack**
    - Spend a Weapon's Grit cost to roll the attack according to the Range.
2. **Aim**
    - Spend 1 Grit to reroll 1 die in your next Attack. Once per turn.
3. **Move**
    - Move up to 1 Short Range distance for every Grit spent.
4. **Dodge**
    - Roll 1B for every Grit spent to try avoiding damage.
5. **Use Item**
    - Spend the item's Grit cost and roll with any applicable dice or Skills.
6. **Prepare**
    - Plan an Action to be taken outside of your turn. Once per turn.
7. **Improvise**
    - Spend at least 1 Grit and roll any applicable Skill to attempt a task.

### Attack
Spend a Weapon's Grit cost to roll the attack according to the Range. THe target takes damage equal to the number of Hits you roll minus any Defense the target has.

### Aim
Spend 1 Grit to reroll 1 die in your next Attack. Once per turn. Before taking the Attack Action, you can spend 1 Grit to reroll one of the dice rolled in your next Attack. You must announce and spend the Grit to Aim _before_ you make your Attack roll. You must take whatever the final result of the dice is.

### Move
Move up to 1 Short Range distance for every Grit spent. Any movement to another location requires a Move Action. Lying down and getting up requires a Move action, whether you are switching positions by choice or getting up from being knocked down.

The Warden may ask a player to roll with a Skill if the movement is difficult. If the Skill roll is failed, the player still spends the Grid for attempting the Action.

> **Note**: When diring a horse, you cannot take the Aim or Dodge Actions, unless stated otherwise for the specific horse.

#### Movement Speed
The description above for the Move Action applies to anything with a normal speed, like humans. Horses have a fast speed that allows them to move up to 2 Short Range distances by spending just 1 Grit.

| Speed | Definition |
| :---: | :---: |
| Fast | Spend 1 Grit to move up to 2 Short Range distances |
| Normal | Spend 1 Grit to move up to 1 Short Range distance |
| Slow | Spend 2 Grit to move up to 1 Short Range distance |
| Very Slow | Spend 3 Grit to move up to 1 Short Range distance |

#### Rough Terrain
In rough terrain, the cost to move during combat is doubled.

### Dodge
Roll 1B for every Grit spent to try avoiding damage. On the next attack against you, you subtract the amount of damage taken by how many Hits you rolled. Any unused amount is forfeited upon the start of your next turn.

### Use Item
Spend the item's Grit cost and roll with any applicable dice or Skills.

### Prepare
Plan an action to be taken outside your turn. Once per turn. When you take the Prepare Action, you are delaying another Action until certain conditions outside of your turn are met. The Grit is spent on your turn ad the Action is lost if not triggered by your next turn.

#### Helping During Combat
You can also use the Prepare Action for Helping. All Helping characters spend the same amount of Grit as the player they are Helping. The Helping character(s) substracts the Grit cost from their _next_ turn.

### Improvise
Spend at least 1 Grit and roll any applicable Skill to attempt a task. Examples include lighting a torch from your Supplies (no Skill required) or distract a monster (roll with Charm).

## Defense
Defense includes damage blocked from the Dodge Action, Cover, and any Defense items used. Monsters also have innate defense. Humans have zero innate defense.

Every time an attack is made or a Status is inflicted, roll the target's Defense and subtract the Hits from the incoming attack or Status.

### Cover
For cover to count, it must be between you and the attacker. Attacks also require line of sight.

| Cover | Benefit | Examples |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| Light Cover | 1B | Hiding behind a small tree; lying in some tall grass |
| Heavy Cover | 2B | Crouching behind a small boulder; in a Dromedary mech |

## Statuses
Each status has a Status Severity that represents how effective the Status is and what it will take to get rid of it. The Status Severity equals the number o successful Hits against a target, subtracting from Dodge or Cover.

A Status like Afraid [2B] means you should roll 2B to determine the Severity. A Status like Afraid [2] means the Severity is always 2 when inflicted.

Status Severity stacks for each Status but cannot exceed 6 for any target, expect for the Trapped Status.

| Status | Skill | Effect | Lasting Effect |
| :---: | :---: | :--- | :--- |
| Burned | Finesse | You lose Health equal to the Status Severity. | Your Max Health is also instantly reduced by 2 when you take this Status for the first time in combat until you receive professional care or are healed by an appropriate Item, like a topical Burn Relief. |
| Dazed | Intuition | After spending Grit to take an Action, but before attempting it, you must roll 1B to determine if you can perform that Action. | |
| Electrocuted | Nerve | You cannot Aim or Dodge, and any attacks/items using Gold dice are converted to Black dice. If you are wearing/carrying anything with a Battery, the Status Severity increases by 1. | |
| Poisoned | Nerve | Roll 2 less dice for every Skill roll. | After this Status is relieved or after combat ends, roll 1 less dice for every Skill roll until you receive professional care or are healed by an appropriate Item, like an Antidote. |
| Trapped | Finnesse or Nerve | You cannot take the Move or Dodge Actions. | |
| Unconscious | Intuition | You cannot spend Grit or take Actions except to attempt relieving this Status on your turn. | |

### Relieving Statuses
You can relieve a Status on your turn by rolling up to the maximum amount of dice from the Skill associated with that Status. Each die rolled for this purpose costs 1 Grit.

If you have enough Grit, you can attempt to relieve multiple Statuses in a turn, as long as they are not attempts on the same Status. You can attempt to relieve each Status only once per turn.

## Abilities
Each Trade as six Abilities, unique to them. All Abilities cost at least 1 Grit to use during combat, unless specified otherwise. Some Abilities are limited to only be used twice per day.

### Ace-in-the-Hole Abilities
Alongside regular Abilities, each Trade has an Ace-in-the-Hole Ability, which can only be used when a player has rolled at least six Aces during a combat situation.

Using an Ace-in-the-Hole Ability or resting by a campfire/town resets the Ace counter.

# Weapons

# Ability Scores
Each character, enemy, and NPC has 4 skills: Charm, Finesse, Intuition, and Nerve.

| 4 | _Difficult_ |
| 5 | _Very Difficult_ |

### Challenge Rolls
If characters are challenging an opponent in some form of content, the Warden can issue a Challenge Roll. Both sides roll the same Skill to determine the outcome. Whoever has the most Hits is successful in winning the challenge. If there's a tie, that means the struggle ain't over yet! Roll again until a winner is determined.

### Helping
A Helping player may roll half of their Skill dice (rounded up) and add the result to the attempting player's Skill result. If multiple players are Helping, then they all roll half of their dice for the Skill and only the most successful roll is added to the attempting player's roll.

# Prestige
Prestige measures your fame and renown. Doing noteworthy things like hunting monsters and completing expeditions allows players to gain Prestige points that they can spend for personal improvement.

| Prestige Cost | Character Improvement |
| :---: | :--- |
