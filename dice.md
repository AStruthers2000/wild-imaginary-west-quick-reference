1 failure.

## Misfire
A misfire happens if using real bullet dice and it lands standing straight up on its end. 

_When any player’s bullet dice Misfire, they are given to the Warden to use for any one roll as they please, including monster attacks or for an NPC's skills. This trail goes both ways however, so the Warden should be prepared to hand over their Misfired dice to the players if the time comes. The Misfired dice return to the owner once they are used in a roll._
